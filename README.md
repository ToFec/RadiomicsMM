# RadiomicsMM
MR based local failure estimation of brain metastases in malignant melanoma

In this project we try to estimate the risk of local recurrence after radiotherapy of malignant melanoma brain metastasis with the use of MR images and corresponding image features. The radiomic features were calculated with pyradiomics v3.0.1. The config-file is named "radiomicsSetting.yaml" and part of this repository. This is an ongoing project and will be updated continuously.
